"""OpenClaw agent for WeaveBench — Chat Completions API variant.

Sibling of ``openclaw_agent.py`` in the same package; the difference is the
upstream API surface used to talk to the LLM provider:

* ``openclaw_agent.OpenClawAgent`` configures pi-ai's ``litellm`` provider with
  ``"api": "openai-responses"`` (the OpenAI Responses API). Used for runs that
  go directly through a LiteLLM-compatible gateway.
* ``openclaw_agent_chat.OpenClawChatAgent`` (this file) configures it with
  ``"api": "openai-completions"`` (Chat Completions API) — required by the
  local OpenAI-compatible chat gateway, which only exposes
  ``/v1/chat/completions``.

Both classes follow the same workflow per task:
  1. ensure node + openclaw are installed inside the VM (cached across tasks)
  2. write provider config (``~/.openclaw/openclaw.json``) pointing at the
     configured ``litellm_base_url``
  3. start ``openclaw gateway --port 18789`` in background (idempotent)
  4. run ``openclaw agent --session-id chat --timeout T --message "<instr>"``
     synchronously, with optional ``DISPLAY=:0`` for GUI tasks
  5. fetch chat.jsonl + agent.log into the per-task results dir

The two classes intentionally have **distinct names** so call sites cannot
silently pick up the wrong implementation by import order — see also
the chat vs. responses runners under ``weavebench/eval/_runners/``.

# Anti-fabrication / tooling policies — MIRROR of weavebench/agents/openclaw_agent.py
# (Responses transport) and weavebench/agents/openclaw_agent_messages.py (Messages
# transport). Edit these in lockstep across all three agent files; they are
# byte-equal by design (no inheritance, no shared module — kept as literal
# copies so each transport file is self-contained and auditable).
#
# added to OpenClawChatAgent (Chat Completions transport)
# so chat-only models (smaller chat-only models) get the
# same anti-cheat guidance as Responses (gpt-5) and Messages
# (claude / gemini). Without this, lite-chat agents would have a ~6.5 KB
# weaker system prompt than the other two transports.

            f"position in pptx EMUs, exact RGB color, cell-level number "

            f"shapes; (d) always SAVE the document after editing and close "
            f"it cleanly — unsaved buffers don't count. Choose whatever "
            f"approach (LibreOffice GUI, soffice headless, scripting "
