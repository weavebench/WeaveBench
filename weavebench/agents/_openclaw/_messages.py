"""OpenClaw agent for WeaveBench — Anthropic Messages API variant.

Sibling of ``openclaw_agent.py`` and ``openclaw_agent_chat.py`` in the same
package. There are now THREE independent agent classes covering the three
upstream API surfaces openclaw / pi-ai can speak:

* ``openclaw_agent.OpenClawAgent`` configures pi-ai's ``litellm`` provider
  with ``"api": "openai-responses"`` (the OpenAI Responses API). Used for
  runs that go directly through a LiteLLM-compatible gateway.
* ``openclaw_agent_chat.OpenClawChatAgent`` configures it with
  ``"api": "openai-completions"`` (Chat Completions API). Used with the
  local OpenAI-compatible chat gateway for non-Claude
  models (gemini, gpt-4.1, etc).
* ``openclaw_agent_messages.OpenClawMessagesAgent`` (THIS file) configures
  pi-ai's ``anthropic`` provider with ``"api": "anthropic-messages"``
  (Anthropic's native ``/v1/messages`` endpoint). Used with a local proxy
  for Claude models — Claude returns ``thinking`` and ``tool_use`` content
  blocks that the OpenAI Chat Completions path cannot represent (HTTP 400
  "Invalid signature in thinking block"); the Anthropic native path carries
  them end-to-end without translation loss.

All three classes follow the same workflow per task:
  1. ensure node + openclaw are installed inside the VM (cached across tasks)
  2. write provider config (``~/.openclaw/openclaw.json``) pointing at the
     configured ``litellm_base_url``
  3. start ``openclaw gateway --port 18789`` in background (idempotent)
  4. run ``openclaw agent --session-id chat --timeout T --message "<instr>"``
     synchronously, with optional ``DISPLAY=:0`` for GUI tasks
  5. fetch chat.jsonl + agent.log into the per-task results dir

The two classes intentionally have **distinct names** so call sites cannot
silently pick up the wrong implementation by import order — see also
the chat vs. responses runners under ``weavebench/eval/_runners/``.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# CLI-only ablation policy block.
#
# Appended to the system prompt ONLY when ``self.gui is False``.  This run
# is an explicit "no-desktop" ablation: the lite sandbox container has no
# X display, no window manager, no desktop, and the bench grader rubric
# items that name GUI applications (Wireshark / DevTools / Inkscape / …)
# are intended to be UNSATISFIABLE in this configuration.
#
# Without this block, agents (especially Claude Sonnet/Opus) commonly:
#   1. apt-install Xvfb + spin up a virtual X server inside the container
#      → defeats the "no desktop" premise.
#   2. pip-install pyautogui / xdotool / wmctrl and try to drive that fake
#      virtual display → mostly fails, wastes max_steps budget.
#   3. fabricate "view_<app>.png" with matplotlib / PIL / Pillow / cairo
#      that *visually mimics* a Wireshark / DevTools window → passes the
#      file-existence + size + OCR + VLM judge_method, inflating the score
#      while not actually exercising any GUI capability.
#
# This policy explicitly prohibits all three, and tells the agent how to
# correctly mark GUI sub-rubric items as INFEASIBLE_NO_DESKTOP so the rest
# of the deliverables can still be graded.  GUI mode (``self.gui is True``)
# is entirely unaffected; this string is never appended in that case.
