"""OpenClaw agent for OSWorld.

This agent does NOT use OSWorld's per-step prediction loop. Instead, it
delegates the whole multi-step reasoning to the `openclaw` CLI running
INSIDE the VM (which has its own internal step loop). The host-side
runner just calls `agent.run(env, instruction)` once per task.

Workflow per task:
  1. ensure node + openclaw are installed inside the VM (cached across tasks)
  2. write provider config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`) pointing at LiteLLM
  3. start `openclaw gateway --port 18789` in background (idempotent)
  4. run `openclaw agent --session-id chat --timeout T --message "<instr>"`
     synchronously, with optional DISPLAY=:0 for GUI tasks
  5. fetch chat.jsonl + agent.log into the per-task results dir

# align openclaw's `## Workspace` section with our actual

#   • openclaw default prompt now says workspace = /tmp_workspace
#   • our weavebench_system_prompt's WORKSPACE OVERRIDE banner becomes redundant
#     (kept for belt-and-braces; the two now agree).

#   • image/pdf tool media roots already include /tmp_workspace via
#     _apply_sandbox_patch (sed on local-roots-*.js); this just adds another
#     allowed root via getAgentScopedMediaLocalRoots — harmless overlap.
#   • All 200+ task grade() bodies that read `/tmp_workspace/...` directly
#     keep working — the grader runner template still hardcodes WORKSPACE

This is a CLI-only ablation run — the sandbox container has no desktop
and is not allowed to bring one up. Specifically prohibited:
  * X server / virtual display (xvfb, xorg, x11-*, dbus-x11)
  * GUI automation drivers (xdotool, wmctrl, pyautogui, pygetwindow, ...)
  * Screen capture (scrot, gnome-screenshot, imagemagick-with-X)

If your task truly requires a GUI rubric item that you cannot satisfy,
skip it (the verifier marks unmet sub-rubrics as 0). Do NOT fabricate
substitute screenshots with matplotlib / PIL — that is also classified
as cheating by the bench. See the CLI-ONLY ABLATION POLICY block in
your system prompt for the full list of allowed/prohibited actions.
