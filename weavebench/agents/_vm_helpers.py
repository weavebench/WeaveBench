"""Shared REST helpers for talking to the OSWorld in-VM Flask shim.

All four harness agents (codex/claudecode/hermes — and the historical
openclaw_agent before its split) speak to a tiny Flask service inside
the VM at ``http://{env.vm_ip}:{env.server_port}/setup/...``. The helpers
in this module wrap that REST surface with the retry/backoff policy
required to survive heavy parallel VM load.

Previously each agent file shipped a near-identical copy of these helpers
(7 funcs × 3 files = ~600 lines of duplication). This module consolidates
them; behavior is byte-identical to the prior per-file copies.
